#MORSEnger

I created this iOS app as a hands-free silent two-way communication tool based on Morse code, inspired by spy movies and the restless tapping of my own feet. Its intended use is by two humans in seated positions, one who produces messages through the raising and lowering of their leg within timed intervals, and the other receiving messages in the form of the phone's short and long vibrations. Its use cases include not only covert communications, but also as a useful and cost-free tool for those with speech and/or hand movement disabilities to communicate effectively with others. Further avenues to explore include a potential note-taking mode, and a way to interface this with other messaging apps to further expand its usability.
